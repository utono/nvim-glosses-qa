**"Ceremony"** in Shakespeare

**Etymology:** From Latin *caerimonia* (sacred rite, reverence). In
Elizabethan usage, "ceremony" meant both formal ritual AND the outward
trappings of rank — crowns, robes, titles. It carried weight: ceremony
wasn't mere show but the visible form of invisible authority.

**Key appearances:**

In *Henry V* 4.1, the word appears 15 times in 50 lines — Henry's
obsessive meditation on what kingship costs. **"What kind of god art
thou, that suffer'st more / Of mortal griefs than do thy worshippers?"**

In *Julius Caesar* 2.1, Brutus strips ceremony from murder:
**"Let's be sacrificers, but not butchers"** — he wants the killing
to BE ceremony, sanctified by intention.

**Thematic pattern:** Shakespeare consistently questions whether ceremony
creates authority or merely decorates it. Kings who trust ceremony are
vulnerable; those who see through it (like Hal becoming Henry V) can
wield it as a tool.

**In this passage:** Canterbury invokes ceremony to persuade Henry —
but Henry has already begun to doubt its substance.
