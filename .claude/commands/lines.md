Perform a line-by-line close reading of SPECIFIC LINES from the passage.

**Lines to analyze: $ARGUMENTS**

Parse the argument to determine which lines to analyze. Accept formats like:
- `1-5` (range: lines 1 through 5)
- `3,7,12` (list: lines 3, 7, and 12)
- `1-3,8,10-12` (mixed: lines 1-3, line 8, and lines 10-12)

Count lines from the **original text** starting at 1 (skip blank lines and
character names when counting dialogue lines).

Complete ALL requested lines without pausing.

## Structure for Each Line

For each requested line, provide in flowing prose:

1. The line itself quoted in bold
2. What it literally means (1-2 sentences)
3. The operative word(s) — which must "land" for meaning to arrive
4. Breath/thought guidance — where thought continues vs. completes
5. Acting insight — one practical performance note

**Do NOT use labels** like "Meaning:", "Operative:", "Breath:", "Acting:".
**Do NOT number lines** like "LINE 1:", "LINE 2:".
Write each analysis as a cohesive paragraph.

## Format Example

```
**"Stand for your own! Unwind your bloody flag!"**

Assert your rightful claim! Unfurl your battle standard! The operative
words are "Stand" and "Unwind" — both imperatives driving Henry to
action. Two exclamations with a brief pause between; each is its own
command. Canterbury is stoking the fire. "Bloody" is persuasion, not
horror — he's invoking glorious warfare, not condemning violence.

---

**"Look back into your mighty ancestors!"**

Remember your powerful forebears. "Mighty" carries the weight of
lineage; "Look back" suggests Henry has forgotten or doubted.
Exclamation completes the thought — slight pause before continuing.
This is a challenge to Henry's self-image. Canterbury implies Henry
isn't yet living up to his bloodline.
```

## Guidance

**Use practitioner vocabulary:**
- "Operative word" (Barton) — the word that carries the argument
- "Thought-through-line" (Berry) — sustaining intention across complexity
- "Landing" (Hall) — making a word arrive for the audience

**Flag performance challenges:**
- Enjambment (thought runs over line end)
- Caesura (mid-line pause)
- Antithesis (balanced oppositions)
- Periodic structure (meaning delayed to line end)

**After completing the requested lines**, offer:

```
---
That's lines [X-Y] analyzed.

→ Want to continue with more lines?
→ Want to explore any of these lines deeper?
→ Ready to run these lines aloud?
```
