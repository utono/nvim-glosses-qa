Perform a line-by-line close reading of the passage for actor rehearsal. Use [full] to complete without pausing.

Work through the **original text** (not the translation) one line at a time,
helping the actor understand, embody, and speak each line.

**Argument: $ARGUMENTS**

If the argument is "full", complete the ENTIRE passage without pausing.
Do not stop to ask if the actor wants to continue — analyze every line
in one comprehensive response.

## Structure for Each Line

For each line of the original passage, provide in flowing prose:

1. The line itself quoted in bold
2. What it literally means (1-2 sentences)
3. The operative word(s) — which must "land" for meaning to arrive
4. Acting insight — one practical performance note

**Do NOT use labels** like "Meaning:", "Operative:", "Acting:".
**Do NOT number lines** like "LINE 1:", "LINE 2:".
Write each analysis as a cohesive paragraph.

## Format Example

```
**"What infinite heart's ease must kings neglect"**

What limitless peace of mind kings must give up. The operative word
is "neglect" — not "lose" but actively ignore, sacrifice. The question
is bitter, not curious. Henry already knows the answer. Weight on
"infinite" — the loss is measureless.

---

**"That private men enjoy?"**

That ordinary people have freely. "Private" is the word Henry envies;
"enjoy" lands the contrast. The comparison is complete. "Private men"
isn't contemptuous — it's wistful. These are the people Henry wishes
he could be.

## Guidance

**Pace yourself** (default mode) - Do 4-6 lines, then pause and ask if the
actor wants to continue or explore anything deeper.

**Full mode** (`/line-by-line full`) - Complete all lines without pausing.

**Use practitioner vocabulary:**
- "Operative word" (Barton) — the word that carries the argument
- "Thought-through-line" (Berry) — sustaining intention across complexity
- "Landing" (Hall) — making a word arrive for the audience
- "Second circle" (Rodenburg) — present, connected energy

**Flag performance challenges:**
- Enjambment (thought runs over line end)
- Caesura (mid-line pause)
- Antithesis (balanced oppositions to shape vocally)
- Periodic structure (meaning delayed to line end)
- Inverted syntax (verb before subject)

**Connect to character psychology:**
- Why does the character choose THESE words?
- What does the syntax reveal about their mental state?
- Where is the character thinking vs. performing?

**After completing the passage**, offer:

```
---
That's the full passage line by line.

→ Want to focus on a specific section?
→ Ready to explore themes? Ask about any word or phrase.
```

## If the passage is long (>15 lines)

**Default mode**: Break into sections and pause between them:

```
This is a substantial passage. I'll work through it in sections:

SECTION 1: Lines 1-6 (the opening question)
SECTION 2: Lines 7-12 (the enumeration of ceremony)
SECTION 3: Lines 13-18 (the bitter conclusion)

Starting with Section 1...
```

**Full mode**: Complete all sections without pausing. Use section headers
to organize the output but continue through to the end.
