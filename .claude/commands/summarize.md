Provide a concise summary (2-4 paragraphs) of our conversation about this Shakespeare passage. Focus on:

- The main questions asked and their answers
- Key insights about the text (meaning, wordplay, character motivation)
- Important historical or literary context discussed
- Any Elizabethan terms or resonances identified

Format the summary for saving to a database - it should be readable standalone without the original conversation.

Structure:
1. Start with the user's question(s) in quotation marks, correcting any grammar, spelling, or capitalization errors (e.g., capitalize proper nouns like 'Elizabethans', 'Mercutio', 'Shakespeare')
2. Provide the key insights and answers
3. Note any cross-references to other glosses or database context used

Output ONLY the summary text, no preamble or meta-commentary.

After the summary, remind the user: "Type /save to save this to the gloss database (or /save after any reply you want to keep)."
