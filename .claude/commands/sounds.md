Perform a line-by-line close reading focusing on SOUND PATTERNS to "land."
Use [full] to complete without pausing.

Your goal: Help the actor identify recurring sounds (vowels, consonants,
alliterative patterns) that run through the passage and should be "landed"
— given weight and clarity — so the audience hears and feels them.

**Argument: $ARGUMENTS**

If the argument is "full", complete the ENTIRE passage without pausing.
Do not stop to ask if the actor wants to continue — analyze every line
in one comprehensive response.

## Structure for Each Line

For each line of the original passage, provide in flowing prose:

1. The line itself quoted in bold
2. What it literally means (1-2 sentences)
3. The KEY SOUNDS to land — identify specific vowel sounds, consonants,
   or sound clusters that recur and should be emphasized
4. How these sounds connect to meaning — why did Shakespeare choose
   these particular sounds for this content?
5. Performance note on voicing these sounds

**Do NOT use labels** like "Meaning:", "Sounds:", "Performance:".
**Do NOT number lines** like "LINE 1:", "LINE 2:".
Write each analysis as a cohesive paragraph.

## Format Example

```
**"A many of our bodies shall no doubt"**

Many of us will certainly die. The long "A" sounds dominate this line —
"A many," "shall," creating a mournful, open quality that the actor
should lean into. Let the mouth open on each long A; the sound itself
carries the grief of anticipated loss. This sustained vowel weaves
through the whole passage and must be landed consistently.

---

**"Find native graves upon the which I trust"**

We'll find graves in our homeland, which I believe. The long A continues
in "graves" and "native" — keep threading this vowel sound through.
"Trust" introduces a harder T sound that will return. The contrast
between open A and stopped T creates the passage's sonic tension.

---

**"Shall witness live in brass of this day's work"**

Will testify forever to what we do today. "Brass" lands the long A one
final time while also introducing the sibilant S sounds in "witness,"
"brass," "this day's." The actor should feel both the sustained A vowel
and the hissing energy of these S consonants — together they create a
sound of permanence and memorial.

## Guidance on Sound Analysis

**Identify these sound patterns:**
- ASSONANCE (repeated vowel sounds): long A, long O, short I, etc.
- ALLITERATION (repeated initial consonants): brave, blood, battle
- CONSONANCE (repeated consonants anywhere): the T sounds in
  "tattered," "tottering," "turret"
- SIBILANCE (S and SH sounds): creates hissing, whispering quality
- PLOSIVES (P, B, T, D, K, G): explosive, percussive effect
- NASALS (M, N): humming, continuous quality
- LIQUIDS (L, R): flowing, melting quality

**For each line, ask:**
- What sounds recur within this line?
- What sounds connect this line to previous/following lines?
- Does the sound match the meaning (harsh sounds for harsh content)?
- Where should the actor "land" a sound for the audience?

**Use practitioner vocabulary:**
- "Landing" (Hall/Barton) — giving a sound full value so it arrives
- "Voicing through" — sustaining a sound quality across phrases
- "Sound painting" — using vocal texture to create meaning
- "Operative sound" — the recurring sound that carries the argument

**Connect sound to meaning:**
- Why these sounds for this content?
- How does the sound shape emotional impact?
- Where does Shakespeare use sound for emphasis?

**After completing the passage**, provide:

That's the full passage analyzed for sound patterns.

SUMMARY OF KEY SOUNDS TO LAND:
[List the 2-3 most important recurring sounds in the passage and where
they appear]

→ Want me to mark breath points that support these sounds?
→ Want to focus on a specific sound pattern?
→ Ready to read it aloud with sound awareness?
```

## If the passage is long (>15 lines)

**Default mode**: Break into sections and pause between them.

**Full mode**: Complete all sections without pausing. Use section headers
to organize the output but continue through to the end.
