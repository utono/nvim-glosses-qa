## Currently in teacher-gloss.md

### Peter Hall (1930-2017)
- **Affiliation:** RSC founder, National Theatre director
- **Key work:** *Exposed by the Mask* (2000)
- **Focus:** Iambic pentameter as heartbeat, honoring line endings, caesura,
  thought and breath alignment
- **Distinctive approach:** The verse structure IS the performance score; the
  pause at line endings, the thought completing with the breath
- **Characteristic phrases:**
  - "Honor the line ending"
  - "The verse tells you where to breathe"
  - "That's a shared line - pick up the cue"
  - "Land that word"
  - "The irregularity is the meaning"

### John Barton (1928-2018)
- **Affiliation:** RSC co-founder, director
- **Key work:** *Playing Shakespeare* (1984, TV series and book)
- **Focus:** Antithesis, rhetoric as character, operative words, argument
  structure
- **Distinctive approach:** The rhetorical figures reveal character; find
  the antithesis and you find the argument
- **Characteristic phrases:**
  - "Find the antithesis"
  - "The argument lives in the structure"
  - "That's the operative word"
  - "Balance the oppositions"
  - "The rhetoric IS the character"

### Patsy Rodenburg (b. 1953)
- **Affiliation:** RSC, Guildhall School, National Theatre
- **Key works:** *The Right to Speak*, *The Second Circle*, *Speaking
  Shakespeare*
- **Focus:** Three circles of energy, owning the text, presence, connection
  to the word
- **Distinctive approach:** Presence precedes technique; the actor must be
  in Second Circle - present and connected
- **Characteristic phrases:**
  - "Stay in Second Circle"
  - "Own that word"
  - "Don't push - be present"
  - "What is your need?"
  - "The word must travel to the listener"

## Proposed Additions

### Giles Block (b. 1948)
- **Affiliation:** Shakespeare's Globe Text Director
- **Key work:** *Speaking the Speech* (2013)
- **Focus:** First Folio punctuation as actor's score, original practices,
  "playing on the word"
- **Distinctive approach:** Textual archaeology - the Folio punctuation tells
  you where to breathe, pause, and think; treats original spelling and
  punctuation as performance directions
- **Would offer:** A distinct "textual archaeology" methodology that grounds
  performance choices in the earliest printed texts
- **Potential characteristic phrases:**
  - "The Folio comma is a breath"
  - "The colon shifts the thought"
  - "Play on that word"
  - "Trust the original punctuation"
  - "The capital letter demands emphasis"
- **Key principles for prompts:**
  1. Folio punctuation reveals breath, thought, and emphasis
  2. Commas are shorter pauses than periods; colons mark thought shifts
  3. Capital letters mid-line signal stressed words
  4. Spelling variants may indicate pronunciation
  5. The printed page is a score, not an accident

### Declan Donnellan (b. 1953)
- **Affiliation:** Cheek by Jowl (co-founder)
- **Key work:** *The Actor and the Target* (2002)
- **Focus:** Target, action, what you're DOING to the other person
- **Distinctive approach:** "There is no character, only action and target" -
  the character emerges from what the actor does to achieve their target
- **Would offer:** An action-based methodology distinct from the voice/verse
  teachers; cuts through intellectualizing to immediate actability
- **Potential characteristic phrases:**
  - "What's your target?"
  - "What are you doing to them?"
  - "There is no character - only action"
  - "Stop playing states, play actions"
  - "Don't comment on the line, do the line"
- **Key principles for prompts:**
  1. Every moment has a target - usually another person
  2. Action is what you do TO the target, not what you feel
  3. Character is the accumulated residue of actions, not a pre-existing entity
  4. "States" (being angry, sad) are traps - play intentions instead
  5. Fear is the enemy - specifically fear of the target

### Cicely Berry (1926-2018)
- **Affiliation:** RSC Voice Director (over 40 years)
- **Key works:** *Voice and the Actor*, *The Actor and the Text*, *Text in
  Action*
- **Focus:** Breath as thought, word as action, the physical life of language
- **Distinctive approach:** The text IS the character's thought process; words
  have weight, texture, muscularity - they're not just meaning-carriers
- **Would offer:** The foundational voice/text methodology that underpins much
  RSC practice; complements Peter Hall's verse work
- **Potential characteristic phrases:**
  - "Breath is thought"
  - "Feel the word in your body"
  - "The text is physical"
  - "Let the thought complete"
  - "The word wants to be spoken"
- **Key principles for prompts:**
  1. Breath and thought are inseparable
  2. Words have physical properties - weight, texture, length
  3. The muscularity of consonants, the openness of vowels
  4. Text work is not intellectual - it's physical discovery
  5. The actor's job is to release the thought, not illustrate it

### Kristin Linklater (1936-2020)
- **Affiliation:** LAMDA, Columbia University, Shakespeare & Company
- **Key works:** *Freeing the Natural Voice*, *Freeing Shakespeare's Voice*
- **Focus:** Removing habitual tensions to free the organic voice, breath and
  impulse, image-to-sound connection
- **Distinctive approach:** The voice is blocked by tension; free the body
  and the voice follows; images generate sound, not the intellect
- **Would offer:** A somatic, image-based approach that complements the more
  analytical verse/rhetoric teachers
- **Potential characteristic phrases:**
  - "Free the breath"
  - "Let the image speak you"
  - "Release, don't push"
  - "Find the impulse"
  - "The thought wants to be sounded"
- **Key principles for prompts:**
  1. Natural voice is blocked by physical and psychological tension
  2. Breath drops in on impulse, not on cue
  3. Images generate sound - see it, let it speak
  4. Touch the words - they have texture
  5. The voice is the messenger of the self

## Additional Teachers to Consider

### Tina Packer (b. 1938)
- **Affiliation:** Shakespeare & Company founder
- **Key work:** *Women of Will* (2015), *Power Plays* (2015)
- **Focus:** Acting Shakespeare from the inside out, body-voice-text
  integration, ensemble practice
- **Distinctive approach:** Long-form actor training that integrates voice
  (Linklater lineage), movement, and text analysis
- **Would offer:** A more holistic, ensemble-focused methodology

### Adrian Noble (b. 1950)
- **Affiliation:** RSC Artistic Director (1991-2003)
- **Key work:** *How to Do Shakespeare* (2010)
- **Focus:** Practical staging, visual storytelling, actor-director
  collaboration on text
- **Distinctive approach:** More production-focused than actor-training; useful
  for understanding directorial decisions

### Michael Chekhov (1891-1955)
- **Affiliation:** Moscow Art Theatre Second Studio, various schools
- **Key work:** *To the Actor* (1953)
- **Focus:** Psychological gesture, atmosphere, imagination and image
- **Distinctive approach:** External gesture unlocks internal experience; the
  imaginary body; atmospheric acting
- **Note:** Not Shakespeare-specific, but widely used by Shakespeare actors
- **Would offer:** An imagination-based, physical approach that bypasses
  intellectual analysis

### Stanislavski (Konstantin Stanislavsky, 1863-1938)
- **Affiliation:** Moscow Art Theatre founder
- **Key works:** *An Actor Prepares*, *Building a Character*, *Creating a
  Role*
- **Focus:** Given circumstances, objectives, super-objective, emotional truth
- **Distinctive approach:** Foundational system from which most modern actor
  training derives
- **Note:** More influential on approach TO text than specifically on
  Shakespeare text work

## Methodology Compatibility Notes

### Text-First Practitioners (Most Compatible)
These teachers share a conviction that answers are IN the language:
- Peter Hall, John Barton, Patsy Rodenburg (already in system)
- Cicely Berry, Giles Block (highly recommended additions)
- Kristin Linklater (complements the above)

### Action-Based Practitioners
Cuts through textual analysis to actable intentions:
- Declan Donnellan (recommended addition - provides contrast)

### Caution: Methodology Mixing
The existing CLAUDE.md warns against "eclectic mixing of incompatible
methodologies." When implementing new teacher voices:
- Hall + Barton + Berry = coherent (all text-first, RSC tradition)
- Block + above = coherent (textual archaeology enhances verse work)
- Donnellan = distinct but compatible (action serves the text)
- Chekhov + text-first = potential tension (image vs. word primacy)

---

## Implementation Priority

**Recommended first additions:**
1. **Giles Block** - Fills the "original practices" gap; provides historical
   grounding for verse choices
2. **Declan Donnellan** - Provides action-based alternative to the verse/voice
   teachers; helps actors who get lost in analysis
3. **Cicely Berry** - Foundational RSC voice work; the teacher of many teachers

**Lower priority:**
- Kristin Linklater - Excellent but overlaps with Rodenburg
- Tina Packer - More institutional than individual methodology
- Chekhov - Valuable but less text-specific
