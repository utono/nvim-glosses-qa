## A Comprehensive Discussion

---

## Initial Query: Christian Perspectives on Shakespeare Across Three Eras

**Question:** Recommend literary critics that write about Shakespeare from a Christian perspective. Recommend critics before WW2, between WW2 and Vietnam, and after the Vietnam war.

### Before WWII (Pre-1939)

**G. Wilson Knight** (1897-1985)
- Though he wrote well into the late 20th century, his foundational work began in the 1930s

## Harold Goddard: A Significant Omission

**Follow-up:** Why did you not include Harold Goddard?

You're absolutely right - that's a significant oversight. **Harold C. Goddard** (1878-1950) absolutely deserves to be on this list, particularly in the WWII to Vietnam era section.

**Harold C. Goddard**
- *The Meaning of Shakespeare* (published posthumously in 1951, two volumes)
- One of the most influential humanistic and spiritually-oriented readings of Shakespeare
- Emphasizes moral and spiritual dimensions, inner life of characters, and ethical conflicts
- Reads the plays as deeply concerned with spiritual truth and moral growth
- His approach is broadly Christian/spiritual without being dogmatically theological
- Known for sensitive, detailed close readings that explore psychological and spiritual depth
- Particularly influential on readers seeking Shakespeare's wisdom and moral insight

Goddard's work is actually one of the most important examples of Shakespeare criticism that takes the plays' spiritual and moral dimensions seriously. He reads Shakespeare as a profound moral teacher and spiritual guide, which aligns very much with what you were asking for.

Goddard's *The Meaning of Shakespeare* is really essential reading for anyone interested in spiritually and morally engaged Shakespeare criticism. His work bridges the gap between devotional reading and serious literary criticism in a way that few others have managed.

## Elaboration: Critics in Goddard's Tradition

### Critics Similar to Goddard

**A.C. Bradley** (1851-1935)
- *Shakespearean Tragedy* (1904)
- While not explicitly Christian, deeply concerned with moral order, conscience, and spiritual psychology
- Treats characters as having inner spiritual lives worth exploring
- Influenced Goddard's character-centered approach
- Examines tragedy as moral and metaphysical crisis

**G. Wilson Knight** (1897-1985)
- *The Wheel of Fire* (1930), *The Imperial Theme* (1931), *The Crown of Life* (1947)
- Explores archetypal patterns: death/resurrection, redemption, spiritual transformation
- Sees plays as "expanded metaphors" expressing spiritual truths
- Particularly strong on the romances as redemptive journeys
- More symbolic/mystical than Goddard but similarly concerned with spiritual meaning
- *The Christian Renaissance* (1962) explicitly addresses religious themes

**Northrop Frye** (1912-1991)
- *Fools of Time* (1967), *A Natural Perspective* (1965)
- Though a literary theorist, deeply influenced by Christian typology and biblical patterns
- Sees comedies and romances as following patterns of death/rebirth, exile/return, loss/recovery
- Less devotional than Goddard but explores similar archetypal spiritual journeys
- *The Great Code* (1982) on the Bible influenced his Shakespeare work

**Maynard Mack** (1909-2001)
- *Everybody's Shakespeare* (1993)
- Humanistic critic concerned with moral imagination
- Examines how Shakespeare explores ethical dilemmas and human conscience
- Not explicitly Christian but treats plays as serious moral philosophy

### More Explicitly Christian/Theological Critics

**Roy Battenhouse** (1912-1996)
- *Shakespearean Tragedy: Its Art and Its Christian Premises* (1969)
- More overtly theological than Goddard
- Reads tragedies as morality plays showing consequences of sin and pride
- Sometimes criticized for being too allegorical, but deeply learned
- Sees Hamlet as a flawed revenge-seeker, Macbeth as a study in damnation
- Controversial but substantial

**Paul N. Siegel** (1916-2005)
- *Shakespeare in His Time and Ours* (1968)
- Marxist critic but also wrote on Christian elements
- *Shakespearean Tragedy and the Elizabethan Compromise* (1957) examines Christian providential order

**R.M. Frye** (1920-2005)
- *Shakespeare and Christian Doctrine* (1963)
- Argues against reading plays as Christian allegory
- BUT provides excellent survey of Christian theology available to Shakespeare
- Useful for understanding historical Christian context without over-reading

### Recent Critics in Goddard's Spirit

**Peter Leithart**
- *Brightest Heaven of Invention* (1996)
- Reformed Protestant theological reading
- Treats Shakespeare as engaging seriously with Christian questions
- More explicitly theological than Goddard but similarly concerned with moral depth

**Joseph Pearce**
- *The Quest for Shakespeare* (2008)
- Catholic perspective
- Biographical approach arguing Shakespeare was crypto-Catholic
- Readable, accessible, though sometimes speculative

**Clare Asquith**
- *Shadowplay: The Hidden Beliefs and Coded Politics of William Shakespeare* (2005)
- Argues for Catholic coding in the plays
- Controversial but interesting on religious context

**Beatrice Groves**
- *Texts and Traditions: Religion in Shakespeare 1592-1604* (2007)
- Scholarly examination of biblical allusions and liturgical echoes
- Less devotional than Goddard but excellent on religious texture

**Ken Jackson**
- *Separate Theaters: Bethlem ("Bedlam") Hospital and the Shakespearean Stage* (2005)
- *Shakespeare and Religion: Early Modern and Postmodern Perspectives* (2011, co-edited)
- New Historicist but takes religious questions seriously

### Goddard's Particular Strengths

What makes Goddard special:

1. **Character as Spiritual Journey**: Sees characters developing morally and spiritually across plays - Hamlet's growth, Lear's redemption through suffering, Prospero's achieving forgiveness

2. **Shakespeare as Wisdom Teacher**: Treats the plays as containing genuine insight into how to live, not just as aesthetic objects

3. **Anti-Violence Theme**: Goddard emphasizes Shakespeare's critique of violence, revenge, and militarism - sees plays advocating for imagination, mercy, and love over force

4. **Close Reading**: Detailed attention to language, imagery, and dramatic structure in service of moral/spiritual interpretation

5. **Optimism about Human Nature**: Unlike Bradley's more tragic view, Goddard tends to see possibilities for redemption and growth

6. **Integration**: Combines psychological insight with spiritual awareness - characters' inner conflicts are both psychological and moral/spiritual

### Critics Who Share These Qualities

**Marjorie Garber**
- *Shakespeare After All* (2004)
- Not explicitly Christian but treats plays as profound explorations of human nature
- Accessible, comprehensive, morally engaged
- Similar to Goddard in treating Shakespeare as relevant wisdom

**Frank Kermode**
- *Shakespeare's Language* (2000)
- Linguistic focus but deeply concerned with meaning and interpretation
- Treats language as vehicle for moral and psychological complexity

**Stephen Greenblatt**
- Known as New Historicist, but *Will in the World* (2004) and *Tyrant* (2018) show engagement with moral questions
- Less spiritual than Goddard but interested in Shakespeare's ethical imagination

**Martha Nussbaum** (philosopher)
- Writes on Shakespeare in *Love's Knowledge* (1990) and elsewhere
- Treats literature as moral philosophy
- Examines how Shakespeare explores ethical reasoning and emotional intelligence

### The Goddard Tradition

The critics most in Goddard's tradition share:
- Belief that Shakespeare was a serious moral thinker
- Interest in character psychology and spiritual development
- Willingness to engage with plays' ethical and spiritual questions
- Resistance to purely aesthetic, political, or cynical readings
- Emphasis on Shakespeare's humanism and depth

The challenge is that academic criticism since the 1980s has moved away from this approach toward historicism, cultural materialism, feminism, and post-structuralism. These approaches are valuable but often skeptical of Goddard-style "wisdom seeking."

**Contemporary alternatives** that maintain some of Goddard's spirit:

- **Harold Bloom** (1930-2019): *Shakespeare: The Invention of the Human* (1998) - not Christian but sees Shakespeare as teaching us about human inwardness and depth

- **Jonathan Bate**: *The Genius of Shakespeare* (1997), *Soul of the Age* (2009) - accessible, humanistic, though more historically grounded than Goddard

## A.C. Bradley: The Father of Character Criticism

**Andrew Cecil Bradley** (1851-1935) is arguably the most influential Shakespeare critic of the 20th century, despite being controversial and somewhat out of fashion in contemporary academia.

### His Major Work

**Shakespearean Tragedy** (1904)
- Focuses on the four major tragedies: *Hamlet*, *Othello*, *King Lear*, *Macbeth*
- Based on lectures he gave as Professor of Poetry at Oxford (1901-1906)
- Became the dominant approach to Shakespeare for decades
- Still widely read and profoundly influential

**Oxford Lectures on Poetry** (1909)
- Includes essays on Antony and Cleopatra, Coriolanus, and other topics
- Shows his broader literary and philosophical interests

### Bradley's Approach

**Character as Real People**
Bradley treats Shakespeare's characters as if they were real human beings with psychological depth, personal histories, and inner lives that extend beyond what's explicitly in the text. This seems obvious now, but it was somewhat revolutionary.

He asks questions like:
- How many children had Lady Macbeth?
- What was Hamlet like before his father's death?
- Why does Iago hate Othello so intensely?
- What happened to Lear's wife?

Critics mocked these questions (especially the Lady Macbeth one), but Bradley's point was that characters must have coherent inner lives for us to find them believable and moving.

**Tragedy as Spiritual/Moral Crisis**
For Bradley, tragedy involves:

1. **Exceptional individuals** with greatness of soul who are brought down
2. **Moral order in the universe** - not Christian providence exactly, but a sense that the universe responds to moral violations
3. **Tragic waste** - the loss of something noble and valuable
4. **Self-division** - characters torn between competing goods or between their better and worse natures

He writes: "The whole or the order against which the individual part shows itself powerless seems to be animated by a passion for perfection: we cannot otherwise explain its behaviour towards evil."

**The Tragic Flaw (Hamartia)**
Bradley is famous for the "tragic flaw" interpretation:
- Hamlet's inability to act (though Bradley's reading is more nuanced than this summary)
- Othello's jealousy and trustingness
- Lear's pride and blindness
- Macbeth's ambition

But Bradley doesn't see these as simple "flaws" - they're often connected to the character's virtues. Hamlet's reflectiveness, Othello's passionate nature, Lear's kingliness, Macbeth's imagination.

### Bradley's Key Insights

**On Hamlet:**
- The play's central mystery is Hamlet's delay
- But delay isn't simple cowardice or inability to act - Hamlet acts decisively in other situations
- Bradley sees Hamlet as suffering from melancholia (what we'd call depression)
- His father's death and mother's remarriage have created a spiritual crisis
- The world has become meaningless to him: "How weary, stale, flat, and unprofitable / Seem to me all the uses of this world"
- He's not just unable to kill Claudius - he's unable to find meaning in action itself
- Yet Bradley also sees Hamlet's spiritual growth across the play

**On King Lear:**
- Bradley considers this Shakespeare's greatest achievement, though *Hamlet* is more popular
- Emphasizes Lear's spiritual journey from proud king to suffering human being
- The play strips away all social pretense to reveal bare humanity
- Sees redemption through suffering - Lear learns to see, to feel, to love
- The ending is devastatingly tragic precisely because Lear has achieved such growth
- Famous question: Is the play too painful to be a good stage play? (He thinks maybe yes)

**On Othello:**
- Othello is not "easily jealous" - quite the opposite
- He's trusting, open, noble - which makes him vulnerable to Iago
- Iago represents motiveless malignity - evil for its own sake
- Othello's tragedy is that his nobility is turned against itself
- The handkerchief matters not as object but as symbol of Othello's destroyed faith

**On Macbeth:**
- Shortest and most concentrated tragedy
- Macbeth has imagination and conscience - he sees the horror of his deeds
- Lady Macbeth is not a simple villainess - she must "unsex" herself, must steel herself against her nature
- The play shows the psychological and spiritual disintegration that follows from evil action
- Macbeth becomes increasingly isolated, hollow, nihilistic
- Yet retains a certain grandeur even in his final "sound and fury" speech

### Bradley's Method

**Close Reading:**
- Careful attention to language, imagery, structure
- Treats every line as potentially significant
- Assumes Shakespeare knew what he was doing and was consistent

**Aristotelian Framework:**
- Uses Aristotle's *Poetics* as foundation
- Tragedy should arouse pity and fear, leading to catharsis
- The tragic hero should be neither perfectly good nor completely evil
- Peripeteia (reversal) and anagnorisis (recognition) are crucial

**Hegelian Influence:**
- Bradley studied German philosophy, especially Hegel
- Sees tragedy as involving collision between competing goods or rights
- Not evil vs. good, but good vs. good
- The tragic hero is often destroyed by the very qualities that make them admirable
- There's a moral order that "works" but at terrible cost

**Psychological Realism:**
- Characters must be psychologically coherent
- Their actions must follow from their natures and situations
- Internal states matter more than external events

### Criticisms of Bradley

**"Character Criticism" Limitations:**
- L.C. Knights's famous essay "How Many Children Had Lady Macbeth?" (1933) mocked Bradley's approach
- Critics argue characters aren't real people - they're dramatic functions, patterns of language
- Bradley sometimes seems to ignore that these are plays meant for performance, not novels

**Historical Blindness:**
- New Historicists criticize Bradley for ignoring Elizabethan context
- He reads Shakespeare as timeless rather than historically situated
- Doesn't address questions of power, gender, colonialism, race in historically informed ways

**Overemphasis on Psychology:**
- Post-structuralists argue he treats language as transparent window to character
- Ignores how language itself constructs meaning
- Too focused on individual consciousness vs. social/political forces

**Idealism:**
- His "moral order" can seem vague, wishful
- Not sufficiently skeptical about whether the plays endorse this moral vision
- Projects his own late Victorian values onto Renaissance plays

### Why Bradley Matters (Still)

Despite these criticisms, Bradley remains essential:

**1. He Takes the Plays Seriously as Art**
- Not just historical documents or ideology
- Treats them as containing genuine insight into human nature
- Assumes Shakespeare was a profound thinker, not just entertainer

**2. He's a Brilliant Close Reader**
- His analyses of specific scenes, speeches, and dramatic moments are often stunning
- He notices things others miss
- His eye for patterns and connections is extraordinary

**3. He Captures What It's Like to Experience the Plays**
- His criticism emerges from genuine engagement with the plays as drama
- He writes about what it feels like to watch/read Shakespeare
- Takes emotional and moral impact seriously

**4. He's Foundational**
- Almost all subsequent Shakespeare criticism responds to Bradley
- Even critics who reject him must define themselves against him
- Understanding Bradley helps you understand the field

**5. His Influence on Other Critics**
- Goddard is deeply Bradleian
- Wilson Knight builds on Bradley while adding symbolic/mythic dimensions
- Even hostile critics often use Bradley's insights while rejecting his method

### Bradley's Style

He writes beautifully - clear, elegant, thoughtful prose. Academic but accessible. He's genuinely trying to understand the plays, not display cleverness or advance a theory.

His lectures feel like a wise, deeply read teacher sharing insights with students who care about literature. There's humility alongside authority - he admits puzzles and uncertainties.

### Bradley vs. Goddard

**Similarities:**
- Both treat characters as having inner lives worth exploring
- Both see Shakespeare as serious moral artist
- Both do close reading in service of understanding meaning
- Both resist cynical or reductive interpretations
- Both are accessible to general readers, not just academics

**Differences:**
- **Tone**: Bradley is more tragic, darker; Goddard more optimistic, sees possibilities for redemption
- **Religion**: Bradley's "moral order" is philosophical/abstract; Goddard more explicitly Christian/spiritual
- **Violence**: Goddard emphasizes Shakespeare's anti-violence themes; Bradley less so
- **Focus**: Bradley concentrates on four tragedies; Goddard covers nearly all plays
- **Growth**: Goddard emphasizes characters' spiritual development; Bradley more on their tragic fall
- **Structure**: Bradley is systematic, Aristotelian; Goddard more interpretive, finding meanings

### Where to Start with Bradley

**Begin with:**
1. His lecture on King Lear in *Shakespearean Tragedy* - probably his greatest single piece of criticism
2. The general introduction to *Shakespearean Tragedy* - outlines his theory of tragedy
3. His essay on Hamlet if you love that play

**The Structure of Shakespearean Tragedy:**
Each play gets:
- Long analytical lecture on the whole play
- Supplementary notes on specific problems or passages
- Deep dives into character psychology, plot structure, imagery

**Most Influential Sections:**
- On Hamlet's melancholy and delay
- On King Lear's apocalyptic power
- On Othello's nobility and Iago's motiveless malignity
- On Macbeth's imagination and conscience

### Bradley's Legacy

He created the template for character-based psychological criticism. Even critics who reject his approach often smuggle his insights back in. When we talk about Hamlet's psychology or Lear's journey or Macbeth's guilt, we're in Bradley's world.

For readers interested in Shakespeare as moral and spiritual artist, Bradley is essential. He takes the plays' moral vision seriously without being preachy. He finds genuine tragedy - not just pessimism or nihilism, but tragic waste and loss that matters because what's lost has value.

Combined with Goddard's more optimistic and explicitly spiritual approach, Bradley gives you a rich foundation for understanding Shakespeare as serious moral and psychological explorer of human nature.

## Forgiveness in *The Tempest*: Christian Fulcrum

### Critics Who Read "I Do Forgive" as the Play's Turning Point

This is exactly the kind of reading several Christian-oriented critics make. Here are the key figures:

#### Most Direct on This Point

**G. Wilson Knight**
- *The Crown of Life* (1947) - his book on Shakespeare's romances
- Explicitly reads *The Tempest* as Christian redemption drama
- Sees Prospero's forgiveness as the spiritual climax
- Connects it to Christ's forgiveness from the cross
- Views the romances as Shakespeare's "crown" - culminating in forgiveness and reconciliation
- Would absolutely treat "I do forgive" as the play's turning point
- Sees progression from tragedy (justice, revenge) to romance (mercy, forgiveness)

**Roy Battenhouse**
- Would read Prospero's choice of "virtue" over "vengeance" as explicitly Christian
- Connects to Matthew 5:44 ("Love your enemies") and the Lord's Prayer ("Forgive us our trespasses")
- Sees the play as moral/spiritual allegory
- Prospero as God-figure choosing mercy over wrath
- The island as purgatorial space where souls are tested and purified

**Robert Hunter**
- *Shakespeare and the Comedy of Forgiveness* (1965)
- Entire book built around forgiveness as central to late Shakespeare
- Reads *The Tempest* as culmination of forgiveness theme
- Explicitly Christian framework
- Connects to parable of the Prodigal Son and other biblical forgiveness narratives
- Prospero's renunciation of revenge as Christian victory over "old Adam"

#### Strong on This Theme

**Barbara Mowat**
- *The Dramaturgy of Shakespeare's Romances* (1976)
- Discusses biblical and liturgical patterns in the romances
- Forgiveness as sacramental act
- The tempest itself as purgation leading to reconciliation

**Howard Felperin**
- *Shakespearean Romance* (1972)
- Reads romances through Christian typology
- Prospero's forgiveness as Christ-like act of grace
- The play moves from Old Testament justice to New Testament mercy

**Derek Traversi**
- *Shakespeare: The Last Phase* (1954)
- Spiritual reading of late plays
- Forgiveness as transcendence of natural justice
- Christian reconciliation as theme

**Peter Milward, S.J.**
- *Shakespeare's Religious Background* (1973)
- *Biblical Influences in Shakespeare's Great Tragedies* (1987)
- Jesuit scholar who reads Catholic/Christian themes throughout
- Would connect Prospero's forgiveness to Christ's passion
- Sees sacramental dimensions in the reconciliation scenes

#### Contemporary Critics on Forgiveness Theme

**R.V. Young**
- Catholic literary critic
- Has written on Christian elements in Shakespeare
- Would emphasize Prospero's choice as victory of grace over nature
- Connects to Augustine and medieval Christian thought

**Peter Leithart**
- *Brightest Heaven of Invention* (1996)
- Reformed Protestant reading
- Treats Prospero's forgiveness as theological statement
- Connects to justification by grace rather than works

**Maurice Hunt**
- *Shakespeare's Religious Allusiveness: Its Play and Tolerance* (2004)
- Detailed analysis of religious language and themes
- Would note biblical echoes in forgiveness language
- Connects to Christian teaching on mercy

### The Specific Theological Reading

These critics would make arguments like:

**1. The Fulcrum Moment**
- Prospero has power to destroy his enemies (storm, imprisonment, potential execution)
- He chooses "virtue" over "vengeance" - explicit moral/theological choice
- This choice transforms the play from revenge tragedy to redemptive comedy
- Everything after this moment flows from forgiveness: reconciliation, return to Milan, Miranda's marriage

**2. Biblical Parallels**
- Matthew 6:14-15: "For if you forgive others their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you"
- Matthew 5:44: "Love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you"
- Luke 23:34: Christ on cross: "Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do"
- Ephesians 4:32: "Be kind to one another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another, as God in Christ forgave you"

**3. Prospero as God/Christ Figure**
- Controls nature (the tempest)
- Judges and tests souls (Alonso, Sebastian, Antonio)
- Has power to condemn or save
- Chooses mercy over justice
- Renounces power ("I'll break my staff, I'll drown my book")
- Christ's kenosis - emptying of divine power

**4. The Theological Language**

Prospero's actual words (Act 5, Scene 1):
```
Yet with my nobler reason 'gainst my fury
Do I take part. The rarer action is
In virtue than in vengeance. They being penitent,
The sole drift of my purpose doth extend
Not a frown further.
```

Christian critics note:
- "Nobler reason" vs. "fury" = divine vs. carnal nature
- "Virtue" vs. "vengeance" = grace vs. law, New vs. Old Covenant
- "The rarer action" = exceptional, Christ-like, contrary to fallen human nature
- "They being penitent" = repentance precedes forgiveness (though Antonio notably doesn't repent, making Prospero's forgiveness even more generous)

Later:
```
For you, most wicked sir, whom to call brother
Would even infect my mouth, I do forgive
Thy rankest fault—all of them
```

The "I do forgive" is direct, performative speech - the forgiveness happens in the speaking, like absolution.

**5. The Play's Structure as Christian Drama**

- **Act 1-4**: Old Testament - law, judgment, testing, justice
- **Act 5**: New Testament - grace, forgiveness, reconciliation
- The fulcrum is Prospero's choice
- Everything resolves through forgiveness: Alonso reunited with Ferdinand, Prospero with Milan, Miranda's marriage brings new generation

### Critics Who Note the Problem

Some critics note that this reading has complications:

**Stephen Orgel** (Arden editor)
- Notes Prospero's forgiveness is imperfect
- He forgives but doesn't forget: "most wicked sir, whom to call brother / Would even infect my mouth"
- Antonio never repents or speaks after being forgiven
- Caliban is left behind
- The forgiveness may be grudging or incomplete

**Barbara Mowat** (Folger editor)
- Notes tension between Prospero's words and his evident anger
- Forgiveness may be willed rather than felt
- This actually makes it more Christ-like - choosing virtue against natural inclination

**Paul Cantor**
- *Shakespeare's Rome* (1976)
- Notes difference between classical and Christian virtue
- Classical = vengeance is honorable
- Christian = forgiveness is virtue
- Prospero transcends classical ethics

### Additional Voices

**Harold Goddard**
- *The Meaning of Shakespeare* (1951)
- Sees Prospero's forgiveness as hard-won spiritual victory
- Connects to Shakespeare's overall theme: imagination and love triumph over force
- The "rough magic" he renounces is violence/coercion
- Forgiveness is the higher magic

**Northrop Frye**
- *A Natural Perspective* (1965)
- Not explicitly Christian but uses Christian typology
- The romances follow death/resurrection pattern
- Forgiveness = resurrection into new life
- Loss and recovery, exile and return are baptismal patterns

**Frances Yates**
- *Shakespeare's Last Plays: A New Approach* (1975)
- More interested in Hermetic/Neoplatonic magic
- But still sees spiritual transformation
- Prospero's renunciation as spiritual enlightenment

### Where This Reading Appears in Practice

Look for discussions of:
1. **"The rarer action is in virtue than in vengeance"** - seen as theological statement
2. **Prospero's abjuring of "rough magic"** - renouncing worldly power for spiritual truth
3. **The masque in Act 4** - often read as showing cosmic harmony restored through forgiveness
4. **Alonso's repentance** - Christian confession and absolution pattern
5. **Ferdinand and Miranda** - new generation born from reconciliation, prelapsarian innocence

### Best Single Source

**Robert Hunter's *Shakespeare and the Comedy of Forgiveness*** (1965) is probably the most sustained argument for exactly this reading. He traces forgiveness through the comedies and romances and sees it as explicitly Christian theme culminating in *The Tempest*.

### Modern Resistance

Contemporary criticism (New Historicist, post-colonial, feminist) tends to resist this reading:
- Sees Prospero as colonizer, not Christ-figure
- Notes he doesn't free Caliban
- Questions whether his forgiveness is genuine or self-serving
- Emphasizes power dynamics rather than spiritual transformation

But for critics in the tradition of Goddard, Bradley, Wilson Knight, Battenhouse - the forgiveness moment is absolutely the fulcrum, the spiritual climax, the point where revenge tragedy becomes Christian comedy of redemption.

## Prospero's Authoritarianism: Old Testament/Yahweh Characteristics

### Criticism on Prospero's "Old Testament" Authoritarianism

This is a fascinating line of interpretation that several critics have pursued, though often implicitly rather than explicitly in terms of "Jewish characteristics." The argument generally focuses on the theological distinction between Old Testament (Yahweh) and New Testament (Christ) models of divine behavior.

#### Critics on Prospero's Imperfect Christianity

**Stephen Orgel** (Arden editor, 1987)
- Notes Prospero's forgiveness is grudging and incomplete
- "For you, most wicked sir, whom to call brother / Would even infect my mouth, I do forgive"
- This is forgiveness in words only - his actual feelings remain vengeful
- He resembles an Old Testament God: wrathful, jealous of power, demanding obedience
- His "virtue" is willed, not felt - more law than grace

**Barbara Mowat**
- Observes Prospero never actually relinquishes control
- He choreographs everything, even the "spontaneous" reconciliations
- His forgiveness comes from a position of absolute power
- This resembles Yahweh's covenant relationship with Israel: conditional, hierarchical
- Contrast with Christ's forgiveness from position of powerlessness (the cross)

**Paul Cantor**
- *Shakespeare's Rome* (1976) and other works
- Distinguishes classical, Hebraic, and Christian ethics
- Prospero operates under Hebraic law: strict justice, eye for eye, testing and proving
- His "forgiveness" is forensic/legal rather than sacrificial/gracious
- He demands repentance before forgiveness (Alonso must show penitence)
- Christ forgives before repentance ("Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do")

#### The Yahweh Parallel

**G. Wilson Knight** (inadvertently)
- While Knight reads Prospero as Christ-figure, he notes the problematic elements
- Prospero as creator/controller of the island world
- His jealous guarding of Miranda
- His anger and threats (against Caliban, against Ferdinand)
- His testing of loyalty
- This actually resembles Yahweh more than Christ

**Jan Kott**
- *Shakespeare Our Contemporary* (1964)
- Much more skeptical reading
- Sees Prospero as tyrant, not savior
- His "forgiveness" is power move, not grace
- He remains in control throughout
- This is Old Testament divine sovereignty, not New Testament kenosis (self-emptying)

### Theological Typology: Law vs. Grace

Several critics note the play's tension between two theological models:

**Old Testament/Yahweh Model:**
- Absolute sovereignty and control
- Wrathful response to disobedience
- Testing and trials (Alonso's wandering, Ferdinand's log-bearing)
- Covenant conditional on obedience
- Jealous guarding of what's "mine" (Miranda)
- Magic as power over nature
- Forgiveness granted from position of strength
- Justice as primary attribute

**New Testament/Christ Model:**
- Self-emptying, renunciation of power
- Forgiveness from weakness (the cross)
- Grace freely given, not earned
- Unconditional love
- Forgiveness of enemies without their repentance
- Mercy as primary attribute
- Sacrifice rather than sovereignty

**The Argument:**
Prospero claims to follow the Christian model ("The rarer action is / In virtue than in vengeance") but actually operates under the Old Testament model. He:
- Never gives up actual control
- Forgives only after his enemies are completely in his power
- Requires demonstrations of penitence
- Threatens punishment repeatedly
- Maintains hierarchy and authority
- Returns to Milan as Duke (doesn't renounce worldly power)

### Renaissance Context and Jewish/Christian Distinction

**James Shapiro**
- *Shakespeare and the Jews* (1996)
- Discusses Renaissance Christian supersessionism
- Old Testament = law, wrath, works
- New Testament = grace, love, faith
- "Jewish" often coded as "legalistic, vengeful, materialistic"
- "Christian" coded as "merciful, spiritual, generous"
- This dichotomy pervades Renaissance thought

**Harold Fisch**
- *The Dual Image: The Figure of the Jew in English and American Literature* (1959)
- Notes how Old Testament figures could represent either:
  - Noble patriarchs and prophets (positive)
  - Vengeful, legalistic, superseded religion (negative)
- Prospero might embody this ambivalence

**Julia Reinhard Lupton**
- *Citizen-Saints: Shakespeare and Political Theology* (2005)
- Sophisticated reading of theological politics in Shakespeare
- Discusses how Renaissance drama negotiates between classical, Hebraic, and Christian models of authority
- Prospero as figure caught between dispensations
- His "conversion" to forgiveness is incomplete

### The Specific "Jewish" Characterization

**Few critics explicitly use "Jewish" terminology**, but several note parallels to Old Testament divine attributes:

**1. Jealous God**
- Prospero's possessiveness of Miranda
- "She is mine own"
- His fury at even Ferdinand approaching her
- Exodus 20:5: "I the Lord thy God am a jealous God"

**2. Testing and Trials**
- Ferdinand must prove himself through labor
- Alonso must wander and suffer before reconciliation
- This resembles God testing Abraham, Job, Israel in wilderness
- Not the freely offered grace of the New Testament

**3. Conditional Covenant**
- Prospero's relationship with Ariel: "Thou shalt be free" - but only after service
- His treatment of Caliban: obedience demanded, disobedience punished
- Old Testament covenant: "If you obey... then I will..."
- Contrast with New Covenant: grace not dependent on works

**4. Wrath and Vengeance Restrained but Not Eliminated**
- Prospero chooses not to kill his enemies
- But this is restraint, not transformation
- Yahweh in Old Testament often restrains wrath but doesn't eliminate it
- Christ offers unconditional love, not merely restrained vengeance

**5. Magic as Divine Power**
- Prospero's "rough magic" resembles divine sovereignty
- Control over nature, spirits, human minds
- This is power over creation, not incarnational participation in it
- Old Testament God as transcendent controller vs. New Testament God as immanent participant

### Contemporary Critical Perspectives

**Post-Colonial Critics** (Stephen Greenblatt, Paul Brown, Peter Hulme)
- Don't use "Jewish" language but note authoritarianism
- Prospero as colonizer who:
  - Claims natural right to rule
  - Dispossesses native (Caliban)
  - Uses language as tool of control
  - Justifies domination through superior knowledge/civilization
- This resembles European Christian colonizers claiming superiority over "heathen"
- But the psychological pattern resembles Old Testament conquest narratives (Joshua, Judges)

**Ania Loomba**
- *Gender, Race, Renaissance Drama* (1989)
- Notes Prospero's patriarchal authoritarianism
- Control over daughter's sexuality
- This resembles Old Testament patriarchy more than New Testament's (relative) softening

**Debora Shuger**
- *Political Theologies in Shakespeare's England* (2001)
- Discusses how Renaissance theology navigated relationship between Old and New Testament models of authority
- Divine right monarchy often drew on Old Testament kingship
- Prospero embodies this tension: claims Christian virtue but exercises Old Testament sovereignty

### The Supersessionist Problem

**Important caveat**: Much of this criticism relies on Christian supersessionist theology - the idea that Christianity "completes" or "surpasses" Judaism. This theology itself is problematic:

**Critics who note this:**
- Modern Jewish scholars point out that "Old Testament God = wrathful, New Testament God = loving" is a caricature
- Hebrew Bible contains abundant mercy, love, forgiveness
- New Testament contains judgment and wrath
- The dichotomy itself may be antisemitic

**Julia Reinhard Lupton** is particularly good on this:
- Notes how Renaissance drama both relies on and questions these categories
- Prospero's "failure" to be fully Christian might be read positively: he maintains justice alongside mercy
- The play doesn't simply endorse Christian supersessionism

### Specific Textual Evidence Critics Use

**1. Prospero's anger never fully disappears:**
- Even in forgiveness speech, he can barely bring himself to call Antonio "brother"
- He threatens Caliban even in Act 5: "Go, sirrah, to my cell"
- His final words about Caliban: "this thing of darkness I / Acknowledge mine" - ownership, not liberation

**2. He doesn't free his slaves:**
- Ariel gets freedom only after final service
- Caliban remains subject
- This is manumission (master freeing slave), not abolition (recognizing slavery is wrong)
- Old Testament allows slavery; New Testament (theoretically) transcends it

**3. The masque (Act 4):**
- Juno and Ceres, classical goddesses
- Emphasis on chastity, fertility, natural order
- Noticeably lacks Christian symbolism
- When Prospero remembers Caliban's plot, he destroys the masque in fury
- His temper is still Yahweh-like: the wrathful God destroying idolatry

**4. The epilogue:**
- Prospero asks audience to free him with applause
- But also: "release me from my bands / With the help of your good hands"
- Some read this as requiring human cooperation for divine grace
- More Old Testament (covenant: you do this, I do that) than New Testament (grace freely given)

### Synthesis: The Argument

The critical argument runs like this:

1. **Prospero claims Christian virtue** ("virtue" over "vengeance")

2. **But his actual behavior remains Old Testament:**
   - Authoritarian control
   - Conditional forgiveness
   - Testing and trials
   - Anger barely restrained
   - Power never truly relinquished

3. **This makes him more Yahweh than Christ:**
   - Yahweh: sovereign, powerful, wrathful but capable of mercy, demanding obedience
   - Christ: self-emptying, powerless, unconditionally loving, suffering servant

4. **The play may be critiquing incomplete conversion:**
   - Renaissance awareness that "Christian" society often operated on Old Testament principles
   - Divine right monarchy = Old Testament kingship, not Christian servanthood
   - The difficulty of actually living New Testament ethics in a political world

5. **Or the play may be showing the necessity of both:**
   - Justice and mercy
   - Law and grace
   - Authority and love
   - A ruler can't be purely Christ-like and still rule

### Key Sources

**For this reading:**
- **Stephen Orgel**, Arden *Tempest* introduction
- **Paul Cantor**, various works on Shakespeare and political theology
- **Julia Reinhard Lupton**, *Citizen-Saints*
- **Debora Shuger**, *Political Theologies in Shakespeare's England*
- **James Shapiro**, *Shakespeare and the Jews* (for context on Renaissance Jewish/Christian distinctions)

**For the post-colonial version** (less explicitly theological):
- **Stephen Greenblatt**, "Learning to Curse" essay
- **Paul Brown**, "'This thing of darkness I acknowledge mine'"
- **Peter Hulme**, *Colonial Encounters*

### The Counterargument

Some critics defend Prospero:

**Barbara Mowat** and others argue:
- The difficulty of his forgiveness makes it more genuine, not less
- He's human, not divine - of course his forgiveness is imperfect
- The play shows the struggle to be Christian, which is realistic
- His renunciation of magic is genuine sacrifice
- The epilogue's vulnerability is Christ-like

**Northrop Frye**:
- The romances show integration of justice and mercy, not one over the other
- Prospero embodies both Old and New Testament virtues
- This is maturity, not failure

This is a rich vein of interpretation that takes seriously the theological dimensions of the play while questioning whether Prospero successfully embodies Christian ideals or remains caught in an Old Testament model of divine authority.

## Conclusion

This conversation has explored a rich tradition of Shakespeare criticism that takes seriously the moral, spiritual, and theological dimensions of the plays. From Bradley's psychological and moral framework to Goddard's optimistic spiritual readings, from Wilson Knight's symbolic and mythic interpretations to contemporary theological criticism, there's a substantial body of work that reads Shakespeare as a serious moral philosopher and spiritual artist.

The discussion of *The Tempest* demonstrates how these approaches can illuminate both the plays' aspirational Christian themes (forgiveness, grace, redemption) and their complications (the difficulty of actually embodying Christian ideals, the tension between justice and mercy, the challenge of relinquishing power).

These critics offer alternatives to purely historicist, materialist, or post-structuralist readings while maintaining scholarly rigor and attention to textual detail. For readers interested in what Shakespeare has to teach us about how to live - about virtue, forgiveness, spiritual growth, and moral struggle - this tradition remains essential and rewarding.
